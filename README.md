# CMU-15-112-Summer-2020-Fundamentals-of-Programming
[Course link](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/index.html)

## Description of the course
A technical introduction to the fundamentals of programming with an emphasis on producing clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code using top-down design, informal analysis, and effective testing and debugging. 
Starting from first principles, we will cover a large subset of the Python programming language, including its standard libraries and programming paradigms. 
We will also target numerous deployment scenarios, including standalone programs, shell scripts, and web-based applications. 
This course assumes no prior programming experience. Even so, it is a fast-paced and rigorous preparation for 15-122. Students seeking a more gentle introduction to computer science should consider first taking 15-110. 
NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer Science course.

## Learning Objective
* Develop computational problem-solving skills using Python as a tool to be applied to new problems, especially in the student's home academic discipline
* Produce clear, robust, and efficient code in Python by: 
  * employing modular, top-down design
  * using sequential, conditional, and loop statements where appropriate
  * using strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries where appropriate
  * using objects and classes where appropriate
integrating recursive functions where appropriate
proactively designing and writing test cases to effectively test and debug code
* Develop an effective programming style based on established standards, practices, and guidelines
* Describe the difference between programming and Computer Science, and gain exposure to some of the Big Ideas of Computer Science (e.g., Computability)
* Explain and analyze the efficiency of algorithms by:
  * proving the running time (Big-O) of various well-known searching and sorting algorithms
  * determining (not proving) the running time (Big-O) of a small piece of code
  * describing the difference between small code optimizations and more substantive algorithmic optimizations
* Design and implement event-based graphical animations
* Develop and write a substantial (500-1500 line) program in Python to implement a solution to a term project of their choosing over one week
